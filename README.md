# Yellow-sass

YellowSass is a perfect copy of a provided image via library Bootstrap and especially with SCSS (SASS) features. We have either all Bootstrap native files which we can modify and adapt when needed, or SCSS _custom file where we can also acreat own style in order to achive the same result of gabarit.jpg. Some javascript features like image carroussel also has been added to dynamize the page. This mini-project has been realized during the Web Development course at Garage 404 from 28 to 30 mars 2023.
